# About me
I am a fourth-year PhD student in School of Engineering at [**National University of Singapore**](http://nus.edu.sg/), supervised by Prof. [**Andrew Lim**](https://www.limandrew.org/) and Prof. [**Chee Yeow Meng**](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ). I received my B.E. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, [**Xidian University**](http://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2018. While completing several innovative projects, I have also published several papers in recommended journals and conferences, such as **ICCV, TKDE, CVPR, ACM MM** and **NeurIPS**.

My research interests lie in 
- Graph Neural Networks;
- Computer Vision (2d image and 3d point cloud);
- Spatio-temporal Data Mining.

***I expect to graduate in the summer of 2022 and am currently seeking potential job opportunities, either in industry or research positions. I cannot wait to try out various chances, so please feel free to contact me!***
