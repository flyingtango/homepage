# About me
I am a fourth-year PhD student in School of Engineering at [**National University of Singapore**](http://nus.edu.sg/), supervised by Prof. [**Andrew Lim**](https://www.limandrew.org/) and Prof. [**Chee Yeow Meng**](https://scholar.google.com.sg/citations?user=99AJNXEAAAAJ). I received my B.E. degree from the School of Computer Science and Technology, [**Xidian University**](http://en.xidian.edu.cn/) in 2018. While completing several innovative projects, I have also published several papers in recommended journals and conferences, such as ICCV, TKDE, CVPR, ACM MM and NeurIPS.

My research interests lie in 
- graph neural networks;
- computer vision including 2d image and 3d point cloud;
- spatio-temporal data mining.

***I expect to graduate in the summer of 2022 and am currently seeking potential job opportunities, either in industry or research positions. I cannot wait to try out various chances, so please feel free to contact me!***
